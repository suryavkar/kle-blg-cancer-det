# Computer-aided Cancer Detection

A deep learning model, based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), is used for identifying prostate cancer tissue, using patches derived from whole slide images stained with hematoxylin and eosin, provided by [KLE Hospital, Belgavi](https://www.klehospital.org).

Due to confidentiality reasons, raw data cannot be shared. [`model.ipynb`](model.ipynb) contains snippets of some of the data.
Final model cannot be made public. [`model.ipynb`](model.ipynb) is one of the models trained during development of the project. The overall training process is outlined in the notebook.

Other files contain some of the pre-processing techniques used to refine the model.
